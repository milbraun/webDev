    <h1>Gob bless me on my path</h1>
    <p><strong>Lorem ipsum</strong>, or <em>lipsum</em> as it is sometimes known, 
        is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web desings.
        The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th
        century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
        <strong><em>Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em></strong> for use in 
        a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
    </p>
    
    <p><h3><em>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
        aliqua.
        </em></h3>
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of <em>lorem upsum</em> is to create a natural looking block of text 
        (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. 
        A practice not without <u>controversy</u>, laying out pages with meaningless filler
        text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on desing, not content.
    </p>

    <p>
        The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used 
        it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled
        the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites,
        and stock designs. Use our <u>generator</u> to get your own, or read on for the authoritative

    <H1>Origns and Discovery</H1>
    <p>
        <h1>Lorem ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from 
            Cicero's ist-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.
        </h1>
    </p>
    <h2>HEDONIST ROOTS</h2>
    <p>
        Until recently, the prevailing view assumed <em>lorem ipsum</em> was born as a 
        nonsense text. <strong>"It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually 
        says nothing,"</strong> <em>Befrore & After</em> <u>magazine answered a curious 
        reader</u>,  <strong>"It's 'words' loosely approximate the frequency
        with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty
         real."</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>As Cicero would put it, "Um, not so fast"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The placeholder text, beginning with the line 
        <em>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"</em>, 
        looks like Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is <u>credited</u>
        with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seerin a sample of
        <em>lorem ipsum</em>, his interst was piqued by <em>consectetur</em> - a genuine, 
        albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin disctionary led McClintock to a passage 
        from <em>De Dinibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> ("On the Extremes fo Good and Evil"),
        a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular, the garbled words of <em>lorem ipsum</em> bear an unmistakable 
        resemblance to sections 1.10.32-33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage 
        exercpted below:
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>
            "Neque porro quisquam est, qui <strong>dolorem ipsum</strong> quia 
            <strong>dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed</strong>
            quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam
            aliquam quaerat voluptatem."
        </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        A 1914 English translation by <u>Harris Rackham</u> reads:
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>
            "Nor is there anyone who loves ou pursues or desires to obtain 
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
            occur in which toil and pain can produce him some great pleasure."
        </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts of <em>
        lorem ipsum's</em> origin, however, the "how and when" still remain something
        of a mystery, with competing theories and timelines.
